Follow the steps below to run the HR Policy & Leave Assistant on your computer.

✅ 1. Download / Clone the Project

If using Git:

git clone https://github.com/VaishnaviNaik659/HR-Assistant-Agent.git


Or simply download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

✅ 2. Make sure these files exist in the folder

Your project folder should contain:

app.py
hr_agent_system_prompt.txt
requirements.txt

✅ 3. Install Python (if not installed)

Install Python 3.8+ from:

👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

During installation:
✔ Check the box “Add Python to PATH”

✅ 4. Install Dependencies

Open Terminal / CMD / PowerShell inside your project folder:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Since your project only needs Streamlit, the file contains:

streamlit


This installs Streamlit in seconds.

✅ 5. Run the App

Run this command:

streamlit run app.py

✅ 6. Open in Browser

Streamlit will automatically open the app in your default browser.

If not, visit manually:

👉 http://localhost:8501

📌 7. Use the HR Agent

You will see:

🧑‍💼 HR Policy & Leave Assistant
Ask about leave, benefits, working hours, or simple HR queries.


Type questions such as:

“leave policy”

“what are the total leaves”

“benefits”

“working hours”

“dress code”

“wfh policy”

“pf and gratuity”

The agent will respond instantly using the logic in app.py + the data in your hr_agent_system_prompt.txt.

It should look like : https://hr-assistant-agent-caybgt6jb22gvzpicwq5cz.streamlit.app/

🔍 Troubleshooting

Make sure the TXT file is in the same folder as app.py.

❌ Streamlit does not open browser

Just visit:

http://localhost:8501

❌ Streamlit welcome screen appears

Just press Enter.
